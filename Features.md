This document outlines the feature set required to deliver "Maximum Security" while managing the inherent friction of Mixnet latency and Zero-Knowledge proofs.1. Identity & Onboarding (The "Ghost" Layer)Objective: Prove humanity without revealing identity.F-ID-01: Zero-Knowledge Account Creation:Generates a locally stored Ed25519/Kyber-1024 keypair.No phone number, email, or cloud account linkage.Mnemonic Backup: standard BIP-39 24-word seed phrase for recovery.F-ID-02: RLN Membership (Spam Shield):Proof-of-Humanity: User must provide a cryptographic "stake" to join the network (e.g., a blind signature from a trusted issuer or a minimal crypto-asset lock).Membership Tree Sync: Background synchronization of the RLN Merkle Tree to generate valid ZK proofs for sending.F-ID-03: Disposable Aliases:Users can generate ephemeral QR codes (Aliases) that link to their master public key but cannot be correlated by the network.One-Time Invite Links: Links that expire after a single handshake to prevent social graph mapping.2. Communication Core (The "Quantum" Shield)Objective: Confidentiality that survives the quantum apocalypse.F-COM-01: Hybrid Post-Quantum Messaging:Triple Ratchet: X25519 + Kyber-1024 + Symmetric Ratchet.Header Splitting: Automatic fragmentation of large Kyber keys into multiple Sphinx packets to prevent packet size correlation.F-COM-02: Asynchronous "Mailbox" Delivery:Since peer-to-peer connections may fail, messages are routed to a "Dead Drop" (SURB - Single Use Reply Block) on a random Service Provider node.Client periodically polls the Dead Drop using anonymous fetch requests.F-COM-03: Media "Shredding":File attachments (Images/PDFs) are padded to uniform block sizes (e.g., 32KB).Blocks are sent via different mix routes and reassembled by the recipient.F-COM-04: Disappearing Messages (Timer-based):Local auto-deletion of message history after $T$ time (e.g., 1 hour, 1 week).3. Network & Transport (The "Noise" Layer)Objective: Hide metadata in a forest of noise.F-NET-01: Tunable Anonymity (The "Slider"):High Latency / High Anonymity: Aggressive Poisson delays (3–10s) and high cover traffic volume.Low Latency / Standard Anonymity: Reduced delays (<2s) for active conversations.F-NET-02: Cover Traffic Generator:App generates dummy traffic ("heartbeats") even when idle.Battery Saver Mode: Reduces cover traffic when battery <20%, with a UI warning that "Metadata protection is degraded."F-NET-03: Censorship Evasion:Pluggable Transports: Option to wrap traffic in WSS (WebSocket Secure) or masquerade as a video stream (WebRTC) to bypass DPI firewalls.4. The "Panic" Layer (Physical Defense)Objective: Protect the user during physical seizure.F-SEC-01: Duress Password (Decoy Mode):Entering a specific "Duress PIN" at the lock screen unlocks a Decoy Vault.Decoy Content: Pre-populated, cryptographically valid but "innocent" chats (e.g., grocery lists, casual banter) generated by a local LLM or pre-scripted.Silent Wipe: While the decoy opens, the real keys in the Secure Enclave are silently destroyed.F-SEC-02: Dead Man's Switch:If the app is not opened for $X$ days, local keys are automatically deleted.
